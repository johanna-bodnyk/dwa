			<h3>Add Dishes</h3>
			<p>A dish is a recipe or menu item. Each dish can be part of a meal once, or many times. A dish has its own photos and note, and a link so your friends can find the recipe. But when you add a dish to meal, you can also add new photos and a note for that particular time you ate it.</p>
