<h1>CSCI E-75 &ndash; Project 1</h1>
<h2>Name</h2>
<p>Johanna Bodnyk</p>
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p><img class="float-left" src="johanna.jpg">I work at the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, where I am the Web Editor & Communications Coordinator. I manage <a href="http://cmes.hmdc.harvard.edu/">our Drupal-based website,</a> including writing and formatting the content and making configuration changes and occasional CSS tweaks, but we outsource most development work to an external vendor. My latest web project at work, currently in progress, is to set up a contact database using <a href="http://civicrm.org/">CiviCRM</a> (open-source web-based constituent relationship management software, written in PHP).</p>
<p>Prior to coming to Harvard in 2009, I was a web project manager at a graphic and web design firm in Boston. I graduated from Bard College with an degree in English in 2003, and moved to Boston in 2005. I'm originally from Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg. </p>
<p>Most of my web experience has been learned on the job, but I've taken a few related classes since coming to Harvard: CSCI E-12 &ndash; Fundamentals of Website Development, and CSCI S-1 &ndash; Great Ideas in Computer Science with Java. My specific motive for taking this class is to learn more PHP so that I can do more with Drupal and CiviCRM myself without help from our vendor. More generally, the technical aspects of my job are my favorite parts, and I'm interested in learning more so that I can eventually find a role within Harvard that focuses more on these skills.</p>
